Draconium Rules

## Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons
Draconium has Dragons. Each Dragon has a respective Egg and Drake. Each of these types represents a lifecycle stage of a Dragon. They begin as Eggs, hatch into Drakes, and then grow into Dragons. Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons are not normal cards and cannot be gained or bought in any way. The means by which to acquire these cards is described below.

When including Eggs / Drakes / Dragons in a set, Duchies, Provinces, and Colonies are locked and unavailable to buy until at least one player has grown a Dragon.
## Eggs
Eggs are the first lifecycle stage for a Dragon. When setting up the game, give each player a Roost mat and choose any combination of differently-named Eggs to include in your kingdom set. After setup but before starting the game, each player chooses an Egg from the available set. Players may select the same type of Egg as one another. Each player places the selected Egg on their Roost mat. Cards on the Roost mat are not considered “in play”.

Each Egg has hatch conditions. Once the conditions are satisfied, the Egg hatches immediately into its respective Drake.

After selecting which Eggs to include in the kingdom set, take one of each differently named Eggs and shuffle them, keeping them face down. One by one, each player blindly selects any Egg from the pile. That is the type of Egg they will have when the game starts. Make sure all Eggs are available as each player picks, returning the previously picked card to the pile and reshuffling between each player.

## Drakes and Dragons
Drakes are not gained, but rather “hatched” from Eggs. Dragons are not gained either, but rather “grown” from Drakes. When a Drake hatches or a Dragon grows, resolve its hatch or grow effect (if it has one), then place it face down on your Roost mat. 

For both Drakes and Dragons, when they are face down at the start of a turn, they are flipped face up. When they are face up at the start of your turn, dispatch them.

Drakes and Dragons are never played, but rather “dispatched”. Once a Drake or Dragon is dispatched, it remains dispatched until it is flipped face down. Drakes or Dragons removed from dispatch have been “disengaged”. A Drake may only be disengaged once, after which it “grows” into a Dragon. Dragons continue to be dispatched and disengaged throughout the rest of the game.

On the same turn that a Drake or Dragon is dispatched, resolve it at the moment specified in the card’s instructions. Most Drakes and Dragons resolve “at the start of your turn”, but some may resolve “at the start of your Buy phase”, “at the end of your Buy phase”, “at the end of your turn”, etc. Drakes and Dragons dispatch on their own accord. When it is time to resolve a Drake or Dragon effect, it is not optional. The only way to hinder a Drake or Dragon is with a Delay token.

Despite some having Attack-like effects, Drakes and Dragons are not Attacks and do not get "played" so therefore cannot be blocked by a Moat or Lighthouse.
## Delay Tokens
Each player has one Delay token. It works similarly to the negative effect tokens from Adventures. When a card says to place a Delay token, you place it onto your Drake or Dragon if you have one. If you have no Drake or Dragon, or your Delay token has already been placed, do nothing. When it is time for a player to flip a Drake or Dragon (to dispatch or to disengage it), if their Delay token is placed, they remove the Delay token instead.
## Other Notes Regarding Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons
Note that because Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons are never played, gained, or discarded, they will never be in a position in which they can be removed from your Roost mat. There is no possible circumstance in which an Egg, Drake, or Dragon can be in your deck, hand, discard pile, play area, or any other mat besides the Roost mat. 

When counting the cards in your deck at the end of the game, Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons do not count towards any special preset or post-game scoring condition. A couple of examples of what this means:
They do not count as part of the Supply for Tax or Obelisk.
They are not counted as a part of your deck when using cards like Gardens. 
They are not counted for or against you when using a Landmark like Museum, Wall, or Wolf’s Den.

## Recycling Mat
The Recycling mat may be used in place of the Trash mat in any game. Some cards require its use and note so in a setup clause. In games using the Recycling mat, any card that includes "trash" in the instructions uses "recycle" instead.

The Recycling mat works like the Trash mat, except that when any Supply pile becomes empty, if there are any cards with the same name in recycling, they are returned to their respective Supply pile. This occurs immediately when a Supply pile becomes empty during the player's turn that emptied it. However, if a player triggers this while still resolving a card's instructions, they finish resolving before the recycled cards are returned.

A couple example scenarios:

A player buys the last Province. There are 2 Provinces in recycling. They are both returned to the Supply before the player's turn ends, therefore the game does not end.
A player in a 3 player game has 2 unspent actions and two Witches. There is one Curse left in the Supply and 4 Curses in recycling. The first Witch is played and the single Curse in the Supply is dealt to only one other player. After the current player draws the 2 cards to resolve the first Witch, the 4 Curses in recycling are returned to the Supply. When the player plays the second Witch, both other players receive Curses.
