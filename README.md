# Dominion Draconium

## Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons
Draconium has Dragons. Each Dragon has a respective Egg and Drake. Each of these types represents a lifecycle stage of a Dragon. They begin as Eggs, hatch into Drakes, and then grow into Dragons.

Eggs / Drakes / Dragons are not Kingdom cards; including one or more Eggs / Drakes / Dragons in a game does not count toward the 10 Kingdom card piles the Supply includes. In fact, Eggs / Drakes / Dragons are not considered "cards" at all; any text referring to a "card" does not apply to Eggs / Drakes / Dragons. However, the Eggs / Drakes / Dragons effects are printed on cards in a landscape orientation with red frames.

There are 10 Eggs / Drakes / Dragons, any number of which may be used in a game of Dominion, though it is not recommended to use more than 3 at once. When choosing a random Kingdom, the Eggs may be shuffled into the randomizer deck or a separate sideways card deck.

When including Eggs / Drakes / Dragons in a set:
* Duchies, Provinces, and Colonies are _locked and unavailable to buy_ until _at least one player_ has grown a Dragon.
* All players _must_ select an Egg before the game starts. Any number of players may have the same named Egg.
* Eggs, Drakes, and Dragons do not count towards any special preset or post-game scoring condition. A couple of examples of what this means:
    * They do not count as part of the Supply for Tax or Obelisk.
    * They are not counted as a part of your deck when using cards like Gardens. 
    * They are not counted for or against you when using a Landmark like Museum, Wall, or Wolf’s Den.

## Eggs
Eggs are the first lifecycle stage for a Dragon. Each Egg has a hatch condition. Once the condition is satisfied (or exceeded), resolve its hatch effect (if it has one noted in its instructions) then exchange it for its respective Drake.

Eggs are double-sided. One side of the Egg describes the hatch condition and any hatch effects. The other side has any special setup instructions (if applicable) as well as the Egg's "evolutionary legend" which looks like this (using the Opulent Dragon as an example):

**Exquisite Egg** ⇝ Glittering Drake ⇝ Opulent Dragon

### Setting Up
Eggs are placed on each player's Roost mat before the game begins. Beginning from the very first round, players may start investing into an Egg's hatch condition. You may use whatever means you prefer to assign Eggs, including allowing players to choose aloud. However, it is recommended to use some method of randomization. Here are a few ideas for how to go about Egg assignment:
* Assign each available Egg a number or range, then roll a die or use a digital number randomizer to select an Egg for each player.
* Put one copy of each available Egg in a stack and have each player close their eyes and select blindly, reshuffling before each player chooses.
* Have everyone self-select silently by writing their choice down on a small and secret piece of paper, then everyone reveal their choices at the same time.

## Drakes and Dragons
Drakes are not gained, but rather "hatched" from Eggs. Dragons are not gained either, but rather "grown" from Drakes. Once a player has hatched an Egg into a Drake, they add a new phase to their turn moving forward: the "Dragon phase".

Drakes and Dragons are both double-sided, with one side having dispatch instructions and the other having disengage instructions. The disengaged side also has the Drake / Dragon's evolutionary legend.

### Drake and Dragon States
Drakes and Dragons are not "played", but rather "dispatched" and "disengaged". A Drake and Dragon may also be "delayed" by having a "Delay token" placed on it. The terms "dispatched", "disengaged", and "delayed" refer to the three states of Drakes and Dragons. At any given time, a Drake or Dragon is considered to be in one of these three states.

* If a Drake or Dragon has a Delay token on it, it is considered _delayed_.
* If a Drake or Dragon is on the Roost mat and has no Delay token on it, it is considered _disengaged_ regardless of which side is facing up.
* If a Drake or Dragon is in the play area and has no Delay token on it, it is considered _dispatched_.

### The Dragon Phase
The Dragon phase occurs immediately before the Action phase (or the very beginning of a turn). Resolving a Dragon phase is dependent upon the Drake or Dragon's state and is described below.

* When a Drake or Dragon is _disengaged_-side up on its Roost mat, flip it to  _dispatched_-side up and leave it on the Roost mat. This _is not considered_ a dispatch.
* When a Drake or Dragon is _dispatched_-side up on its Roost mat, dispatch it by removing it from the Roost mat and placing it in the play area (though it is not technically "in play"). The Dragon's instructions are executed at the specified phase(s) over the course of the player's turn. The dispatched Dragon remains in the play area at the end of the current player's turn. While a Drake or Dragon is dispatched in the play area, it is considered dispatched until it has been disengaged.
* When a Drake or Dragon is _dispatched_-side up in the play area, flip it to _disengaged_-side up and move it to the Roost mat. Any dispatch instructions should be resolved at this time.
* When a Drake or Dragon is _delayed_ by having a Delay token on it, the Delay token is removed and no further Drake / Dragon events occur this turn.

## Playing the Game with Eggs / Drakes / Dragons
From the start of the first round, all players should have an Egg and are free to begin satisfying the Egg's hatch condition where possible. The Egg remains on the Roost mat until the hatch condition is met or exceeded, in which case it is hatched before the end of the current player turn. 

When an Egg hatches, resolve any hatch effects (if applicable), then remove the Egg from the Roost mat and replace it with the Drake listed on the Egg's evolutionary legend. Place the Drake on the Roost mat disengaged side up. This initial placement _is not considered_ a disengagement. Drakes have powerful effects, but they are only dispatched then disengaged once. When a Drake is disengaged, it grows into a Dragon before the end of the current player turn.

When Drake grows into a Dragon, resolve any grow effects (if applicable), then remove the Drake from the Roost mat and replace it with the Dragon listed on the Drake's evolutionary legend. Place the Dragon on the Roost mat, disengaged side up. This initial placement _is not considered_ a disengagement. Dragons continue in the dispatch / disengage cycle until the game is over.

## Delay Tokens
Each player has one Delay token. It works similarly to the negative effect tokens from Adventures. When a card says to place a Delay token, you place it onto your Drake or Dragon if you have one. If you have no Drake or Dragon, or your Delay token has already been placed, do nothing. When it is time for a player to flip a Drake or Dragon (to dispatch or to disengage it), if their Delay token is placed, they remove the Delay token instead.

## Draconian Cards
Draconium has Draconian cards. When a card has the Draconian type, it means that it has an Attack-like effect. Despite this, Draconian cards are not Attacks and cannot be blocked by cards light Moat or Lighthouse.

## Clandestine Cards
Draconium has Clandestine cards. When you play any card with a +X Cards instruction and you draw a Clandestine card, you may reveal it. If you do, it will not count against your remaining draws. This effect does not apply when drawing cards for your hand or when playing a card that instructs you to draw to a specific number of cards in hand. It also has no effect on discarding in any way.

### Example Scenarios
* You play a [Village](http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Village) for +1 Card and +2 Actions. With your +1 Card, you draw a Clandestine card. You choose to reveal the Clandestine card and as a result, you do not expend your +1 Card and draw again. Your next card is not a Clandestine card, so the Village is resolved.
* You play a [Village](http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Village) for +1 Card and +2 Actions. With your +1 Card, you draw a Clandestine card. You choose to reveal the Clandestine card and as a result, you do not expend your +1 Card and draw again. Your next card is also a Clandestine card, so may once again choose to reveal it and draw another card. There is no limit to how many Clandestine cards may be drawn at once.
* You play a [Village](http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Village) for +1 Card and +2 Actions. With your +1 Card, you draw a Clandestine card. You choose _not_ to reveal the Clandestine card and as a result you do _not_ draw another card and the Village is resolved.
* You play a [Watchtower](http://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Watchtower) and after which you have 4 cards in hand. The first card you draw is a Clandestine card. Because Watchtower instructs to "Draw until you have 6 cards in hand." and does not include "+X Cards", you may _not_ reveal the drawn Clandestine card. You draw one more card to get to 6 in hand and the Watchtower is resolved.

## Recycling Mat
The Recycling mat may be used in place of the Trash mat in any game. Some cards require its use and note so in a setup clause. In games using the Recycling mat, any card that mentions "trash" in the instructions uses "recycle" or "recycling" instead.

The Recycling mat works like the Trash mat, except that when any Supply pile becomes empty, look through recycling to find all the cards with the same name and return them to the empty Supply pile. When a Supply pile becomes empty, first resolve the remaining instructions on the card that emptied it, then return the recycled cards. The cards are returned before the end of the current turn.

### Example Scenarios

* A player buys the last Province. There are 2 Provinces in recycling. They are both returned to the Supply before the player's turn ends, therefore the game does not end.
* A player in a 3 player game has 2 unspent actions and two Witches. There is one Curse left in the Supply and 4 Curses in recycling. The first Witch is played and the single Curse in the Supply is dealt to only one other player. After the current player draws the 2 cards to resolve the first Witch, the 4 Curses in recycling are returned to the Supply. When the player plays the second Witch, both other players receive Curses.
